# Weather App
a simple web app for weather forecast (in Italian)

---------------
for educational purposes only
---------------

Used modules:
flask (Flask, render_template, redirect,request, url_for)
flask alchemy (SQLAlchemy)
flask-dotenv
os (environ)
requests
datetime

---------------
In this very simple web-app, I access data from Open Weather Map API (htts://openweathermap.org) and I can insert or delete cities from everwhere in the world.
For each city I can see a 7 days forecast (in a separate page).

--------------
v. 1.0 (2020-12-26): completed engine - There's a minimal graphic interface. No CSS, I used Bulma (https://bulma.io)
